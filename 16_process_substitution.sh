# In the previous section we've seen how to chain output of one command to the next one. But what if you want to chain the output of two or more commands to the another one? What if you have a command that takes a file as argument but you would like to process whatever is send to that file?

# Process substitution allows a processâ€™s input or output to be referred to using a filename. It has two forms: output <(cmd), and input >(cmd).

sort file1 > sorted_file1
sort file2 > sorted_file2
diff sorted_file1 sorted_file2
